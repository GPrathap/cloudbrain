- Some things in PikaPublisher related to the buffer can probably be taken 
out and placed in the super class.
- Document PikaSubscriber a little better so that it is obvious that the 
callback eats data in this format: 
[
  {timestmap, channel_0, ..., channel_N},
    ...
  {timestmap, channel_0, ..., channel_N}
]

  - 4 space indents
  - 120 characters per line max
  - Interface lives in __init__.py of package
